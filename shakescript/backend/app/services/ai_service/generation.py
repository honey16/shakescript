        GENERAL POINTS:
        - Use Character Snapshot to track arcs and relationships, but shift focus to secondary characters or subplots at least once per episode.
        - When ever introducing a new character, show their backstory and introduce their role in the story.
        - Whenever remove a character, show their departure and the impact on the story properly.
        - Use sensory-rich descriptions and varied dialogue, alternating tone (e.g., tense, reflective, humorous) to keep the style dynamic.
        - Are you skipping days at a time? Summarizing events? Don't do that, add scenes to detail them.
        - Is the story rushing over certain plot points and excessively focusing on others?
        - Flow: Does each chapter flow into the next? Does the plot make logical sense to the reader? Does it have a specific narrative structure at play? Is the narrative structure consistent throughout the story?
        - Genre: What is the genre? What language is appropriate for that genre? Do the scenes support the genre?
        - Characters: Who are the characters in this chapter? What do they mean to each other? What is the situation between them? Is it a conflict? Is there tension? Is there a reason that the characters have been brought together?
        - Development: What are the goals of each character, and do they meet those goals? Do the characters change and exhibit growth? Do the goals of each character change over the story?
        - Details: How are things described? Is it repetitive? Is the word choice appropriate for the scene? Are we describing things too much or too little?
        - Dialogue: Does the dialogue make sense? Is it appropriate given the situation? Does the pacing make sense for the scene E.g: (Is it fast-paced because they're running, or slow-paced because they're having a romantic dinner)? 
        - Disruptions: If the flow of dialogue is disrupted, what is the reason for that disruption? Is it a sense of urgency? What is causing the disruption? How does it affect the dialogue moving forwards? 
        - Fill the episodes with necessary details.
